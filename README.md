# WavesAway.

WavesAway is your guide for local AM/FM radio stations. 

This platform provides user's with a list of both radio stations and their genres, based on their current Geo-location. 

=========================================

Editions.

**V1** - (2/19/2019): A live proof of concept. This initial version will provide general feedback from a small group of individuals who are testing this 
platform across the U.S. During this testing stage, data will be pulled from a 3rd party, so it's only as accurate and updated as their database is kept.   

* This initial step will help determine how user's respond to the simple UI/UX.

**V2** - (Spring 2019): Version-two will offer more reliable and accurate data as we'll be hosting data for the top 100 U.S. cities ourselves. 
The data will essential contain all radio stations for U.S. cities who's population is greater than 200,000. Managing the data ourselves will 
allow us to make changes frequently and keep the station databases current. 

**V3** - (Summer 2019): Our long-term goal is to not just be a station guide, but to also provide users with a look into what their 
local stations are playing in real-time. A demo for this feature will launch in early Summer 2019.
